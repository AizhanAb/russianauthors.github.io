            <h2>Famous russian authors</h2>
            Russia has produced some of the greatest people in the area of literature. The Golden age of Russian poetry began with Alexander Pushkin who is the founder of Russian literary language and is more commonly 
            known as the ‘Russian Shakespeare’. After the Golden 
            age various genres became popular in Russia, starting 
            from poetry, novels, and short fiction stories to literary realism and symbolism. The work of Russian authors varies from romance, satire, religion and politics. Many have written autobiographies about their interesting lives which have become widely popular, while others wrote about the political conditions of the Soviet Union and its role in the world war. Their work has been published and translated worldwide and has attracted many readers. Here is a list of the top ten greatest Russian authors of all time.
